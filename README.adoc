   - Update all packages

== Configuration File

Filame stores its configuration in `~/.config/filame/config.yaml`

Example configuration:
[source,yaml]
----
deviceName: arch-laptop
githubRepo: https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git
configFiles:
  - sourcePath: /home/user/.config/i3/config
    destinationPath: i3/config
    description: i3 window manager configuration
  - sourcePath: /home/user/.bashrc
    destinationPath: bashrc
    description: Bash configuration
packages:
  - name: vim
    source: official
    description: Text editor
  - name: yay
    source: aur
    description: AUR helper
ignorePatterns:
  - "*.log"
  - "*.tmp"
  - ".cache/*"
  - "*.lock"
----

== Usage Examples

=== Tracking Common Dotfiles

Add these common Arch Linux configuration files:

[source]
----
Source: ~/.config/i3/config          ‚Üí Destination: i3/config
Source: ~/.config/polybar/config     ‚Üí Destination: polybar/config
Source: ~/.bashrc                    ‚Üí Destination: bashrc
Source: ~/.zshrc                     ‚Üí Destination: zshrc
Source: ~/.vimrc                     ‚Üí Destination: vimrc
Source: /etc/pacman.conf            ‚Üí Destination: pacman.conf
----

=== Setting Up Multiple Devices

1. On your first device, configure Filame and add your config files

2. Export configs and push to GitHub

3. On your second device, configure Filame with the same GitHub repo

4. Pull from GitHub to get the latest configs

5. Import configs to apply them to the new device

== Building and Development

=== Build the project:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----

=== Run tests:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew test
----

=== Create a distribution:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew distZip
----

The distribution will be created in `app/build/distributions/`

== Troubleshooting

=== Git Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues when pushing to GitHub:

1. *Using SSH:* Make sure you have an SSH key set up and added to your GitHub account
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
----

2. *Using HTTPS:* Configure Git credentials or use a personal access token
+
[source,bash]
----
git config --global credential.helper store
----

3. Use SSH URLs instead of HTTPS for better authentication

=== Configuration Not Saving

Make sure you have write permissions to `~/.config/filame/`

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/.config/filame
chmod 755 ~/.config/filame
----

=== Repository Clone Failures

Ensure the GitHub repository URL is correct and you have access to it. For private repositories, make sure your Git credentials are configured.
